Just pick up a task, if you have any questions ask and i'll get straight on it!\r\n\r\nPlease feed free to submit a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\nWe are still very early in the project so if you have any ideas just post it!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no installer, there is a task to sort this out. To 'install' the application you will need to build it (Using Visual Studio 2013+) and then set up IIS to look at the output folder. This is currently a WIP as this is not ideal.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-71282070-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
