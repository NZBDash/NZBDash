## Contributors

We are looking for any contributions to the project! Just pick up a task, if you have any questions ask and i'll get straight on it!

Please feed free to submit a pull request!

## Ideas

We are still very early in the project so if you have any ideas just post it!

## Installation

Currently there is no installer, there is a task to sort this out. To 'install' the application you will need to build it (Using Visual Studio 2013+) and then set up IIS to look at the output folder. This is currently a WIP as this is not ideal.
