# NZBDash

NZBDash is a all in one dashboard for your server! 
The goal is to provide basic information about your news reader (SabNZB, NZBGet), your news automation programs (Sonarr, CouchPotato etc.)

## Ideas

We are still very early in the project so if you have any ideas just post it!

## Installation

Currently there is no installer, so to run it locally you will need to build the solution with Visual Studio (2013+, .Net 4.5) and set up IIS correctly with the built solution
