# NZBDash

NZBDash is a all in one dashboard for your server! 
The goal is to provide basic information about your news reader (SabNZB, NZBGet), your news automation programs (Sonarr, CouchPotato etc.) and also information about your system!
So there will be functionality to alert you when disk space on a certain drive is low etc.

## Ideas

We are still very early in the project so if you have any ideas just post it!

## Installation

Currently there is no installer, so to 'install' the application you will need to build it (Using Visual Studio 2013+) and then set up IIS to look at the output folder.
